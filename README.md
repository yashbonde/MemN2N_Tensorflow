# MemN2N_Tensorflow
This is a repository that has my work on Memory Networks using various libraries.

The meomory networks are based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916

Though they are modified to be used in a more practical sense (i.e. weakly supervised, back-prop enabled), known as End-to-end memory networks, as shown in https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895

Check the individal files for more details.
